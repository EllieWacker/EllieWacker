A complete puppy adoption management system built using C#. 

It includes:

Desktop App (WPF):
A user-friendly Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application that allows staff to manage puppies, adoptions, and users locally. Features include adopting puppies, tracking adoption status, and managing user information.

Web App (ASP.NET MVC):
A responsive, full-stack web version of the system built using ASP.NET MVC. It mirrors the functionality of the desktop version, allowing remote access for users to view available puppies and admins to manage the database. It also allows admin to create/update/delete puppies and litters.
